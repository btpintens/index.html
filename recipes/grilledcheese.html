    <p> In many British Colonies a toasty bread and melty cheese combo is referred to as a Cheese Toasty. But, this is America, and 
    we call it a Grilled Cheese. It's about as American as apple pie and babies with guns. As with both those things, 
    it's best not to overthink the process; let your God-given intuition guide the way. And if you can't digest dairy why the 
    hell are you looking up cheese recipes? Move along. </p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>bread - ideally something fluffy and soft, like a sourdough</li>
            <li>butter</li>
            <li>cheese - an assortment is recommended, with emphasis on american and cheddar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>turn your burner to a medium/medium low setting</li>
            <li>butter one side of bread and place the buttered side down in the pan </li>
            <li>while your bread is toasting, place 2-3 layers of your cheese on top
                of the bread</li>
            <li>while the bread continues to toast, and the cheese starts to melt, prepare
                the second piece of bread by buttering just one side of it</li>
            <li>place the "dry" (aka not buttered side) of the bread on top of the bread and cheese 
                platform you have built in your pan</li>
            <li>now is a great time to check the status of your toast. using your preferred utensil
                (knife, spatula, finger) take a peek at the underside of the base layer. depending on
                the level of heat, and the speed in which you've assembled, the underside should 
                start to turn a beatiful golden hue. if this hasn't started to happen, give it another minute.
                maybe turn the heat up a little. but remember: there is no need to rush the process. </li>
            <li>once the bottom layer of bread has achieved your preferred level of brown/golden/burnt it's 
                time to flip the whole thing over. use a spatula, google the plate trick, or throw caution
                to the wind and flip it in the pan like you see done in the movies. </li>
            <li>sit back and wait for this final toast. it should take anywhere from 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>now eat it. i like a diagonal cut but maybe your a Philistine and don't give a hoot
                about aesthetics. you do you. </li>
        </ol>
